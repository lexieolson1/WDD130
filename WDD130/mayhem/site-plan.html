        Makeup is art. It can make a statement, invoke emotion, and even create new characters. In many different professions, it is used to represent what you are about. Drag queens, cosplayers, rock and roll icons, and makeup artists on social media to name a few all use makeup to promote their work and create art. Inspired by alternative rock icons throughout the ages, we created Mayhem. A brand of makeup for those who want to express themselves boldly. We wanted to create a brand that is professional but still affordable so everyone can experiment with their look. Our makeup is high quality and gives anyone the opportunity to create. It is designed to be pigmented. This is how it creates bold looks so effortlessly. We are vegan and cruelty-free, if you have any questions or concerns, please contact our customer support team below.

        The image with the paragraph is repeated down further. For all of these pages, they are longer than shown in the wireframe. I did not extend the wireframe because the rest of the page is a repeat of the paragraph and image connected too it.
